            <b> What is the Indian Premier League?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
        </summary>
        <p class="font">The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise-based Twenty20 competition organised by the BCCI,
            and
            backed by the ICC. It features the world's best cricketers playing - their affiliation decided by open
            auction -
            for eight city-based franchises, owned by a host of businessmen and celebrity consortiums. The first season
            was
            held successfully in India in 2008, while the second edition, which coincided with general elections in
            India,
            was shifted to South Africa. The tournament returned to India for the third edition. </p>

            <b> Why has the IPL generated such a buzz?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
        </summary>
        <p class="font">Two main reasons why. One the football-club concept of the IPL, which is unlike anything
            cricket has
            known. The best players from across the world playing, not on the basis of nationality but dictated
            by
            market
            forces. Second, the sheer financial scale of the IPL is unprecedented at this level of cricket. The
            BCCI
            made
            close to $ 1.75 billion solely from the sale of TV rights ($908 million), promotion ($108 million)
            and
            franchises (approximately $700 million). There are now several players on contracts worth more than
            $1
            million
            annually. It's an entire cricket economy - and one unaffected by recession - out there.</p>

        <summary class="font">
            <b> Who are the franchise owners - celebrities and others?</b>
            <br>
        </summary>
        <p class="font">Mukesh Ambani, the Reliance Industries chairman, acquired the Mumbai franchise for $111.9 million over a 10-year period; beer and airline baron Vijay Mallya, who also owns a Formula 1 team, won the Bangalore franchise for $111.6 million; Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment won the Kolkata franchise for $75 million; the biggest surprise was the Punjab franchise, which went to Preity Zinta, another Bollywood star, and Ness Wadia, together with two other industrialists, for $75 million. Shilpa Shetty, another popular Bollywood star, joined the Rajasthan Royals franchise after the first season. India Cements owns the Chennai-based franchise, while the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers franchise is owned by the Deccan Chronicle group.

            In 2010, two new franchises were added to the IPL family. The Pune franchise was snapped up by Subroto Roy of the Sahara Group for a whopping $375 million, while a consortium of five companies called Rendezvous Sports World shelled out $333.33 million for the Kochi franchise.
            
            The teams (for the first three seasons) are: Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Daredevils, Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals (Jaipur), Bangalore Royal Challengers, Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers (Hyderabad) and Kings XI Punjab (Mohali).
